#Welcome to FitnessFormFixer
As the title implies, this a fitness form fixer app! The app offers various exercises to pick from to judge your form on a particular exercise, having your whole body points (e.g shoulder point, elbow, etc.) as an input through accessing device's live webcam. The app will make a prediction accordingly based on the app pre-trained model, which is a neural network classification model. 

Following that, you can see how well (or not so well) you performed once you "finished" your workout. We will have your Time Under Tension (TUT) and overall performance analyzed real-time as you go through the workout!

- curl (bicep curl)
